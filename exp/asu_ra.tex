  \rCVonly{ % CV gives a list of projects

    \item Projects:

      \begin{rBulletList}
  }

        \item Created a method for identifying extensions installed on \textbf{Chrome~OS} by analyzing the encrypted
          files on the hard drive. Wrote an accompanying crawler in \textbf{Python} (and using \textbf{Ansible},
          \textbf{Celery}, \textbf{MySQL}, \textbf{sshfs}, and \textbf{OpenStack}) to download all extensions on the
          Chrome Web Store and analyze them.\rCVonly{\\
          \emph{Publications:}~\cite{MabeyDFRWS, IASymp_Mabey2015, MabeyBlogCheckout2016, MabeyBlogFixRepo2015}}

        \rCVonly{
        \item Helped design and implement a cloud-based version of the International Capture the Flag (iCTF)
          competition, allowing educators to more easily host their own CTF competitions. Used \textbf{Ansible},
          \textbf{Vagrant}, \textbf{Amazon EC2}, and \textbf{Python} for the implementation and deployment.\\
          \emph{Publications:}~\cite{Trickel2017}
        }

        \item Developed a forensic acquisition approach for web email that reestablishes persistent cookie sessions
          stored by a browser, and automated the process using \textbf{Python} and \textbf{Selenium}.\rCVonly{\\
          \emph{Publications:}~\cite{Paglierani2013}}

        \item Designed and implemented the core components of a modular, highly scalable, collaboration-centric digital
          forensic framework built on the \textbf{OpenStack} cloud architecture. Functions of the components included
          distributed job scheduling, storage management, and concise evidence representation and
          transmission.\rCVonly{\\

    \item Other experience:
      \begin{rBulletList}
  }

        \item Maintained fifteen servers for the lab, including a public-facing router, an \textbf{OpenVPN} server, a
          reverse-proxy web server with \textbf{TLS} certificate management, an \textbf{OpenStack} cloud, switches
          transmitting \textbf{VLAN}-tagged traffic, and a \textbf{GitLab} server.
