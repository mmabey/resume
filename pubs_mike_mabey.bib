@inproceedings{Han2013,
abstract = {Large and complex systems, such as the Smart Grid, are often best understood through the use of modeling and simulation. In particular, the task of assessing a complex system's risks and testing its tolerance and recovery under various attacks has received considerable attention. However, such tedious tasks still demand a systematic approach to model and evaluate each component in complex systems. In other words, supporting a formal validation and verification without needing to implement the entire system or accessing the existing physical infrastructure is critical since many elements of the Smart Grid are still in the process of becoming standardized for widespread use. In this paper, we describe our simulation-based approach to understanding and examining the behavior of various components of the Smart Grid in the context of verification and validation. To achieve this goal, we adopt the discrete event system specification (DEVS) modeling methodology, which allows generalization and specialization of the entities in the model for a customized simulation with specific scenarios. In addition, we articulate metrics for supporting our simulation-based verification and validation and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@inproceedings{Mabey2011,
abstract = {Digital forensic analysis techniques have been significantly improved and evolved in past decade but we still face a lack of effective forensic analysis tools to tackle diverse incidents caused by emerging technologies and the advances in cyber crime. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to address the efficacious deficiencies of current practices in digital forensics. Our framework, called Collaborative Forensic Framework (CUFF), provides scalable forensic services for practitioners who are from different organizations and have diverse forensic skills. In other words, our framework helps forensic practitioners collaborate with each other, instead of learning and struggling with new forensic techniques. Also, CUFF uses and augments current and emerging standards, including DFXML and EDRM XML for concise file representation and efficient resource transmission. In addition, we describe fundamental building blocks for our framework and corresponding system requirements.},

@misc{iCTF_poster,
abstract = {Capture the flag ("CTF") is an interactive security competition in which the competitors use their security skills to find hidden flags. CTFs are a fun and exciting way for security researchers to improve, enhance, and refine their security skills all while competing with one another for fame and glory. Even though various frameworks have been created for hosting CTF events, hosting a CTF event still requires a great deal of time and energy to configure the servers, create the infrastructure, and setup the various services. The goal of this project is to make the hosting of CTFs a much simpler and automated process. The project will achieve this by creating easy-to-use CTF event creation tool that automatically deploys a distributed, highly-available, stable, and configurable CTF framework in the cloud (e.g., AWS, Openstack, etc.). As a result, anyone will be able to quickly and easily create a CTF competition, which will help the security community grow and learn at an even faster pace. Once completed, the system will be used to host the iCTF---the largest educational hacking competition in the world---along with UCSB on March 3--4, 2017.},
