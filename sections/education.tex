\textit{Dissertation:} Forensic Methods and Tools for Web Environments
\begin{CVonly}\begin{quoting}

  The Web is one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of development in today's technology. However, web environments
  also present a set of new challenges for digital forensic examiners, making their jobs even more difficult. In my
  dissertation, I present (1)~a framework for web environment forensics, which gives examiners a method for how to
  approach web-based evidence; (2)~a method to identify extensions installed on encrypted web thin clients without
  breaking the encryption; and (3)~an approach to reconstructing the timeline of events on encrypted web thin clients by
  using service provider APIs as a proxy for directly analyzing the device. I also introduce several structured formats
  that I customized to accommodate the unique features of web-based evidence while also facilitating tool
  interoperability and information sharing.

Digital Forensics: Architecture, Mechanisms, and Case Study}%
% \begin{CVonly}\begin{quoting}
  % In order to catch the smartest criminals in the world, digital forensic examiners need a means of collaborating and
  % sharing information that is not prohibitively difficult to use and that complies with standard operating procedures
  % and the rules of evidence. In this thesis I present the design and implementation of the Collaborative Forensic
  % Framework (CUFF) which is a cloud-based forensic analysis environment that facilitates collaboration among examiners
  % and their trusted colleagues. CUFF makes a positive impact on forensic examiners' efficiency by helping them leverage
  % their network of subject matter experts while also tapping into the scalability and power of the cloud.
