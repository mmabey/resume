  % \begin{rBulletList}
  %
  %   \item Researched forensic techniques for \textbf{Chrome~OS}/\textbf{Chromium~OS} by creating tools in \textbf{Python} and using \textbf{libvirt} to interface with \textbf{KVM/QEMU}. (Project in progress.)
  %
  % 	\item Developed a web email acquisition approach that reestablishes persistent cookie sessions stored by a browser, and automated the process using \textbf{Python} and \textbf{Selenium}.
  % 	%Wrote an accompanying \textbf{Python} script that used \textbf{Selenium} to then interact with the online email account.
  %
  % 	\item Designed and implemented the core components of a modular, highly scalable, collaboration-centric digital forensic framework built on the \textbf{OpenStack} cloud architecture. Functions of the components included distributed job scheduling, storage management, and concise evidence representation and transmission.
  %
  % 	% \item Set up and maintained an \textbf{OpenVPN} installation for the SEFCOM lab.
  %
  % 	%\item Researched methods for performing forensic acquisition on \textbf{Android} devices.
  %
  % 	%\item Acted as a mentor for an undergraduate student that otherwise would not have pursued a master's degree and collaborated with him on the research for his thesis.
